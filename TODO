- Basic layout for controls and inputs - DONE
- Simulation is drawn next to the controls on a canvas - DONE
- Visual explanation of what is drawn: the formulas - DONE
- It is possible to input pi, pi / 2, pi / 4 as inputs - DONE
- Always use the new composition API, migrate the legacy API usage - DONE
- It is possible to speed up the simulation: options "normal", "x10", "x100" - DONE
- Bug: When changing speed or initial conditions cancel the current drawing which is still going on on the canvas - DONE
- Bug it should be possible to change the speed of drawing "on demand" while the drawing is active - DONE
- Clicking the Draw button should terminate the currently ongoing drawing and start a new one - DONE
- Add state management with Pinia - DONE
- It is possible to stop the simulation drawing - DONE
- Add the Resume button to resume the drawing of the simulation (or even better: change the state of the Stop button to Resume) - OK
  -- If inputs are changed Resume should change to disabled Pause - OK
- Add a button to save the image - OK

- It is possible to use one of the pre-selected simulation parameters which would result in an interesting figure

- Add unit tests for the state management


- Add unit tests for components using vitest and vue-test-utils
- Responsive layout: should work on an iPad screen, iPhone screen and smaller 15' old displays

- Deployment to some public hosting site
