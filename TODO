- Basic layout for controls and inputs - DONE
- Simulation is drawn next to the controls on a canvas - DONE
- Visual explanation of what is drawn: the formulas - DONE
- It is possible to input pi, pi / 2, pi / 4 as inputs - DONE

- Always use the new composition API, migrate the legacy API usage

- It is possible to stop the simulation drawing
- It is possible to speed up the simulation: options "normal", "x10", "x100"
- It is possible to use one of the pre-selected simulation parameters which would result in an interesting figure

- It is possible to set the different amplitude
