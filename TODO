- Basic layout for controls and inputs
- Simulation is drawn next to the controls on a canvas

- It is possible to stop the simulation drawing
- It is possible to speed up the simulation: options "normal", "x10", "x100"
- It is possible to use one of the pre-selected simulation parameters which would result in an interesting figure

- It is possible to set the different amplitude
