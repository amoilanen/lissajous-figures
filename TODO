- Basic layout for controls and inputs
- Simulation is drawn next to the controls on a canvas

- It is possible to input pi, pi / 2, pi / 4 as inputs
- Visual explanation of what is drawn: the formulas

- It is possible to stop the simulation drawing
- It is possible to speed up the simulation: options "normal", "x10", "x100"
- It is possible to use one of the pre-selected simulation parameters which would result in an interesting figure

- Add a legend what is being drawn and explanation: formulas and physical interpretation
- It is possible to set the different amplitude
